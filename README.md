# raml-1.0-pro
demo material from the Connect 2016 Using RAML 1.0 Like a Pro presentation

Thanks to everyone who attended the Using RAML 1.0 Like a Pro session at Connect 2016.
I have placed the demo materials from the presentation here for you to explore. Once you
load this up in api-designer, take a moment to examine the api-console panel to
see what the resulting API will look like based on the RAML definitions.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at mrose@avenuecode.com.
